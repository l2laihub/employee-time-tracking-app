# Custom Subscription Plan Implementation Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the process for creating and implementing a tailored subscription plan for clients with specific pricing requirements, such as the example case of $99 per month for 15 users. It covers implementation steps, system limitations, pricing strategy considerations, and CRM documentation procedures.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Assessment and Approval Process

1. **Initial Request Evaluation**
   - Gather client requirements (user count, pricing expectations, feature needs)
   - Calculate the effective per-user rate ($99/15 = $6.60 per user in the example case)
   - Compare with standard pricing tiers to assess discount level
   - Determine if the request aligns with business goals and profitability targets

2. **Approval Workflow**
   - For requests within predefined parameters (e.g., <20% discount): Team lead approval
   - For moderate discounts (20-30%): Department manager approval
   - For significant discounts (>30%): Executive approval
   - Document approval in the designated system

### 2. Technical Implementation

1. **Custom Plan Creation in Billing System**
   - Create a new plan code in the billing system (e.g., `CUSTOM_15USER_99`)
   - Set monthly price at $99 with a fixed user count of 15
   - Configure annual option if requested (typically with 15-20% discount)
   - Set renewal terms and conditions

2. **Feature Entitlement Configuration**
   - Determine which feature set to provide (typically based on closest standard tier)
   - Configure user permissions and access controls
   - Set up any custom limits or quotas
   - Document any feature exceptions or additions

3. **System Configuration**
   - Update user management system to enforce the 15-user limit
   - Configure billing system to handle the custom pricing
   - Set up monitoring for user count to track compliance
   - Implement alerts for approaching user limit

4. **Testing**
   - Verify correct billing amount in test environment
   - Confirm user limit enforcement
   - Test upgrade/downgrade paths
   - Validate feature access and permissions

### 3. Client Communication and Onboarding

1. **Custom Agreement Creation**
   - Draft custom subscription agreement
   - Clearly specify user limits, pricing, and term length
   - Include conditions for exceeding user limits
   - Define renewal terms and price change conditions

2. **Client Onboarding**
   - Provide clear documentation of plan details
   - Set expectations regarding user limits
   - Explain procedures for requesting additional users
   - Schedule follow-up check-ins to ensure satisfaction

3. **Account Configuration**
   - Set up client account with custom plan
   - Configure welcome emails and documentation
   - Assign dedicated account manager if applicable
   - Set up monitoring for usage patterns

## System Limitations and Considerations

### Technical Limitations

1. **Billing System Constraints**
   - Some billing systems may not support truly custom plans
   - Workaround: Create a unique plan code for each custom arrangement
   - Alternative: Use coupon/discount codes applied to standard plans
   - Consider implementing a custom pricing engine for flexibility

2. **User Management Challenges**
   - Fixed user count plans require strict enforcement
   - System must prevent exceeding user limits
   - Consider grace periods for temporary user count fluctuations
   - Implement clear user deactivation procedures

3. **Feature Provisioning**
   - Custom plans may create edge cases in feature entitlement
   - Test thoroughly to ensure proper feature access
   - Document any manual configuration requirements
   - Consider feature flags for granular control

4. **Reporting Complexity**
   - Custom plans may not fit standard reporting categories
   - Create custom report segments for non-standard plans
   - Track metrics separately for custom vs. standard plans
   - Ensure revenue recognition handles custom plans correctly

### Operational Considerations

1. **Support Requirements**
   - Custom plans may require specialized support knowledge
   - Document plan details for support team access
   - Create internal knowledge base articles for each custom arrangement
   - Consider dedicated support contacts for custom plan clients

2. **Renewal Process**
   - Define clear renewal procedures for custom plans
   - Set up advance notifications for renewal discussions
   - Prepare migration paths to standard plans when appropriate
   - Document price adjustment policies for renewals

3. **Scalability Concerns**
   - Too many custom plans increase system complexity
   - Establish limits on total number of custom plans
   - Create standardized "custom" templates for common requests
   - Regularly review custom plans for consolidation opportunities

## Pricing Strategy Considerations

### Financial Impact Analysis

1. **Profitability Assessment**
   - Calculate effective per-user rate ($99/15 = $6.60 in example)
   - Compare to standard tier pricing and cost basis
   - Determine contribution margin for the custom plan
   - Set minimum acceptable margins for custom plans

2. **Lifetime Value Calculation**
   - Project customer lifetime value with custom pricing
   - Compare to standard plan LTV
   - Factor in expansion opportunities
   - Consider strategic value beyond direct revenue

3. **Opportunity Cost Evaluation**
   - Assess resources required to maintain custom arrangements
   - Calculate cost of exceptions to standard processes
   - Evaluate impact on product roadmap and priorities
   - Consider precedent-setting implications

### Strategic Considerations

1. **Competitive Positioning**
   - Evaluate how custom pricing affects market perception
   - Assess competitive response possibilities
   - Document justification for price exceptions
   - Maintain pricing integrity across customer base

2. **Growth Planning**
   - Define clear upgrade paths from custom plans
   - Create incentives to migrate to standard plans over time
   - Establish growth metrics for custom plan accounts
   - Set expectations for future pricing adjustments

3. **Standardization Opportunities**
   - Regularly review custom plans to identify patterns
   - Consider creating new standard tiers based on common requests
   - Develop migration strategies from custom to standard plans
   - Balance flexibility with operational efficiency

4. **Precedent Management**
   - Document justification for each custom arrangement
   - Establish clear criteria for custom pricing approval
   - Create internal guidelines to ensure consistency
   - Regularly review exception patterns
