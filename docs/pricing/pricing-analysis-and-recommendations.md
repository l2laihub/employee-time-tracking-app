2. **Tiered feature sets**: Clear differentiation between basic, professional, and enterprise offerings
3. **Annual discounts**: 15-25% discounts for annual commitments
4. **Free tier limitations**: Typically limited to 1-3 users or have feature restrictions

### Competitor Analysis

| Competitor | Free Tier | Basic Tier | Professional Tier | Enterprise Tier | Annual Discount |

Key observations:

- Per-user pricing typically ranges from $3-20 depending on features
- Annual discounts average around 15-20%

### Customer Price Sensitivity Analysis

Based on industry data and market research:

1. **Small teams (1-10 users)**:
   - Highly price-sensitive
   - Often choose free or low-cost solutions
   - Value simplicity and ease of use over advanced features
   - Conversion rate increases significantly when priced under $10/user/mo

2. **Mid-sized teams (11-50 users)**:
   - Moderately price-sensitive
   - Willing to pay for specific features that address pain points
   - Value reporting, integrations, and team management features
   - Sweet spot pricing: $10-15/user/mo

3. **Large organizations (50+ users)**:
   - Less price-sensitive
   - Value enterprise features, security, compliance, and support
   - Require customization and integration capabilities
   - Expect volume discounts for larger deployments
   - Willing to pay $15-25/user/mo for comprehensive solutions

### Cost Structure Considerations

For SaaS workforce management solutions like ClockFlow:

1. **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**:
   - Industry average: $500-1,500 per customer
   - Requires 6-12 months to recoup with current pricing

2. **Hosting and Infrastructure**:
   - Per-user costs decrease with scale
   - Estimated $0.50-1.00/user/month at scale

3. **Support Costs**:
   - Increase with tier level and promised response times
   - Free tier: $0-1/user/month (community support)
   - Basic tier: $1-3/user/month (email support)
   - Professional tier: $3-5/user/month (priority support)
   - Enterprise tier: $5-10/user/month (dedicated support)

4. **Development and Maintenance**:
   - Fixed costs regardless of user count
   - Advanced features require ongoing development investment
