# Implementation Plan: Dashboard Supabase Integration

## Overview
This document outlines the completed implementation of Supabase integration in both Employee and Admin Dashboards, replacing the previous mock data implementation.

## Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETED

The implementation has been successfully completed with all planned features now using real data from Supabase. For detailed documentation of the current implementation, see:
- [Employee Dashboard Documentation](./features/dashboard/employee-dashboard.md)
- [Admin Dashboard Documentation](./features/dashboard/admin-dashboard.md)

## Implemented Features

### Employee Dashboard
- ✅ Real-time time entry tracking
- ✅ Break management system
- ✅ Job location integration
- ✅ Today's work history
- ✅ Enhanced error handling
- ✅ Loading states
- ✅ Work description support

### Admin Dashboard
- ✅ Department overview
- ✅ Real-time statistics
- ✅ PTO request tracking
- ✅ Timesheet management
- ✅ Employee activity monitoring
- ✅ Break time calculations

## Technical Implementation

### Services Integration
All mock data has been replaced with real data services:

#### TimeEntryService
```typescript
const { data: activeEntry } = await getActiveTimeEntry(user.id);
const { data: todayEntries } = await listTimeEntries(organizationId, {
  employeeId: user.id,
  startDate: startOfToday,
  endDate: endOfToday
});
```

#### JobLocationService
```typescript
const { data: jobLocations } = await listLocations(organizationId);
```

#### Employee Data
```typescript
const { data: activeEmployees } = await supabase
  .from('employees')
  .select(`
    id,
    first_name,
    last_name,
    department,
    member_id,
    organization_id,
    organization_members!inner (
      role
    )
  `)
  .eq('organization_id', organizationId);
```

### Real-time Updates
Both dashboards implement real-time updates using Supabase subscriptions:

```typescript
// Time entries subscription
const timeEntrySubscription = supabase
  .from('time_entries')
  .on('*', payload => {
    if (payload.new.user_id === user.id) {
      refreshTimeEntries();
    }
  })
  .subscribe();

// PTO and timesheet subscriptions
const subscriptions = [
  supabase
    .from('timesheets')
    .on('UPDATE', payload => {
      if (payload.new.status === 'submitted') {
        refreshTimesheets();
      }
    })
    .subscribe(),
  supabase
    .from('pto_requests')
    .on('*', () => refreshPTORequests())
    .subscribe()
];
```

## Testing Results
