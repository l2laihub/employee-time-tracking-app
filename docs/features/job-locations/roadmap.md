# Future Roadmap

## Planned Enhancements

### 1. Location Features

#### Location Grouping
```typescript
interface LocationGroup {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  organization_id: string;
  locations: string[]; // location IDs
  created_at: string;
  updated_at: string;
}
```

Benefits:
- Easier management of multiple locations
- Group-based policies
- Simplified reporting

#### Nested Locations
```typescript
interface NestedLocation extends Location {
  parent_id?: string;
  children: string[]; // child location IDs
}
```

Use cases:
- Building floors
- Department areas
- Sub-locations

#### Location-specific Settings
```typescript
interface LocationSettings {
  location_id: string;
  check_in_buffer: number; // minutes
  auto_clock_out: boolean;
  notification_radius: number;
  custom_rules: LocationRule[];
}
```

### 2. Assignment Features

#### Temporary Assignments
```typescript
interface TemporaryAssignment extends LocationAssignment {
  reason: string;
  approver_id: string;
  duration: number; // days
}
```

Features:
- Duration-based assignments
- Approval workflow
- Automatic expiration

#### Schedule-based Assignments
```typescript
interface ScheduledAssignment extends LocationAssignment {
  schedule: {
    days: string[]; // e.g., ["MON", "WED", "FRI"]
    start_time: string; // e.g., "09:00"
    end_time: string; // e.g., "17:00"
  };
}
```

#### Team-based Assignments
```typescript
interface TeamAssignment {
  team_id: string;
  location_id: string;
  members: string[]; // user IDs
  schedule?: Schedule;
}
```

### 3. Geofencing Improvements

#### Multiple Geofence Shapes
```typescript
interface GeofenceShape {
  type: "circle" | "polygon" | "rectangle";
  coordinates: number[][];
  radius?: number; // for circle
}
```

Features:
- Complex area coverage
- Better accuracy
- Custom shapes

#### Dynamic Radius Adjustment
```typescript
interface DynamicRadius {
  base_radius: number;
  factors: {
    time_of_day: number;
    weather: number;
    crowd_density: number;
  };
}
```

Benefits:
- Adaptive boundaries
- Contextual awareness
- Improved accuracy

#### Location-based Notifications
```typescript
interface LocationAlert {
  type: "enter" | "exit" | "approach";
  radius: number;
  message: string;
  recipients: string[]; // user IDs
}
```
