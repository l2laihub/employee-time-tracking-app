```

## State Management
- Uses React hooks for local state
- Implements custom hooks for:
  - Report filters (useReportFilters)
  - Data sorting (useTableSort)
  - Employee details (useEmployeeDetailFilters)

## Code Organization
- Components: `/src/components/reports/`
  - Main report components
  - Reusable tables
  - Filter controls
- Utilities: `/src/utils/`
  - Date formatting
  - Data calculations
  - Export functions
- Types: `/src/lib/types.ts`
- Mock Data: `/src/lib/mockReportData.ts`

## Best Practices

### Data Handling
- Implement proper data fetching patterns
- Use TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
- Handle loading and error states
- Implement data caching where appropriate

### UI/UX Guidelines
- Consistent table layouts
- Clear data presentation
- Interactive filtering
- Responsive design
- Accessible tables and controls

### Performance
- Implement pagination for large datasets
- Memoize expensive calculations
- Optimize re-renders
- Lazy load report components

## Future Enhancements
- Additional report types
- Advanced filtering options
- Custom report builder
- Data visualization improvements
- Real-time updates
