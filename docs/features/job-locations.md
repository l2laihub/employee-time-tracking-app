# Job Locations Feature

## Overview

The Job Locations feature allows organizations to manage physical work locations, assign employees to these locations, and enforce location-based time tracking through geofencing. This feature is essential for organizations with multiple work sites or those requiring location verification for time tracking.

## Key Components

### 1. Job Location Service (`src/services/jobLocations.ts`)

The Job Location service is the core component that handles all location-related operations. We chose to implement this as a separate service for several reasons:

1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Isolates location management logic from UI components
   - Makes the codebase more maintainable and testable
   - Allows for future extensions without affecting the UI

2. **Centralized Location Management**
   - Single source of truth for location data
   - Consistent handling of location operations
   - Unified error handling and validation

3. **Reusability**
   - Can be used by multiple components
   - Facilitates integration with other features
   - Enables consistent location handling across the application

### 2. Location Data Structure

```typescript
interface Location {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  address: string;
  latitude: number;
  longitude: number;
  radius: number;
  organization_id: string;
  is_active: boolean;
  created_at: string;
  updated_at: string;
}
```

This structure supports:
- Basic location information (name, address)
- Geofencing capabilities (latitude, longitude, radius)
- Organization management (organization_id)
- Soft deletion (is_active)
- Audit trail (created_at, updated_at)

### 3. User Assignment System

```typescript
interface LocationAssignment {
  id: string;
  user_id: string;
  location_id: string;
  start_date: string;
  end_date?: string;
  is_primary: boolean;
}
```

Features:
- Multiple location assignments per user
- Primary location designation
- Assignment date tracking
- Historical assignment records

## Core Functionality

### 1. Location Management

```typescript
// Creating a new location
const result = await createLocation(
  name,
  address,
  latitude,
  longitude,
  radius,
  organizationId
);

// Updating a location
const updateResult = await updateLocation(locationId, {
  name: 'Updated Name',
  radius: 150
});

// Listing active locations
const locations = await listLocations(organizationId);
```

### 2. User Assignment

```typescript
// Assigning a user to a location
const assignment = await assignUserToLocation(
  userId,
  locationId,
  startDate,
  isPrimary
);

// Getting user's locations
const userLocations = await getUserLocations(userId);
```

### 3. Geofencing

```typescript
// Checking if user is within a location's geofence
const isWithinGeofence = await checkUserInGeofence(
  userId,
  currentLatitude,
  currentLongitude
);
```

## Integration Points

### 1. Time Tracking Integration

The Job Location service integrates with time tracking to:
- Validate clock-in/out locations
- Enforce location-based work policies
- Track remote vs. on-site work

### 2. User Management Integration

Connects with user management for:
- Location assignments
- Access control
- User-location relationship management

### 3. Organization Management Integration

Integrates with organization management to:
- Filter locations by organization
- Manage location access permissions
- Handle organization-specific settings

## Error Handling

The service implements robust error handling:

1. **Database Errors**
   - Connection issues
   - Constraint violations
   - Transaction failures

2. **Validation Errors**
   - Invalid coordinates
   - Missing required fields
   - Invalid assignment dates

3. **Business Logic Errors**
   - Overlapping assignments
   - Invalid location changes
   - Geofence violations

## Performance Considerations

1. **Database Optimization**
   - Indexed location queries
   - Efficient geospatial calculations
   - Optimized assignment lookups

2. **Caching Strategy**
   - Frequently accessed locations
   - User assignments
   - Geofence calculations

3. **Batch Operations**
   - Bulk location updates
   - Mass assignment changes
   - Organization-wide modifications

## Security

1. **Access Control**
   - Organization-based isolation
   - User-level permissions
   - Role-based access

2. **Data Protection**
   - Encrypted coordinates
   - Secure assignment data
   - Protected user information

## Future Enhancements

1. **Location Features**
   - Location grouping
   - Nested locations
   - Location-specific settings

2. **Assignment Features**
   - Temporary assignments
   - Schedule-based assignments
   - Team-based assignments

3. **Geofencing Improvements**
   - Multiple geofence shapes
   - Dynamic radius adjustment
   - Location-based notifications

## Testing

Comprehensive testing is implemented through:
1. Unit tests for the service
2. Integration tests with other components
3. End-to-end testing of location features

For detailed testing information, see [Job Location Service Testing](../technical/testing/job-location-service.md).

## Best Practices

1. **Location Management**
   - Use meaningful location names
   - Set appropriate geofence radii
   - Keep location data updated

2. **User Assignments**
   - Maintain clear assignment records
   - Update assignments promptly
   - Document assignment changes

3. **Geofencing**
   - Consider GPS accuracy
   - Account for building layouts
   - Test boundary conditions
